# DnDSoundboard

Soundboard Created with Raspberry Pi to be used in D&amp;D sessions. 


## Intro

In D&amp;D we often try to find ambient sounds or music that fits in with wherever we are in our campaign. There are times when specific sound effects are needed often (every time a spell is cast, whenever you open a door, whenever someone trips, etc.). The goal of this project is to create something that is ready to play whatever sound is necessary with a quick press of a button. 

## Requirements of the project

+ Portability
+ Ability to assign NUMEROUS sounds
+ Cheap
+ Entertaining

## Hardware used for the soundboard

+ Raspberry Pi 3
+ Momentary push buttons
+ 16x2 LCD Screen
+ Wires
+ Toggle LED Lit Cover Switch (for shutdown?)
+ Empty Wooden Cigar Box (Find a better case?)


## Initial Idea of layout

3 rows of 4 push buttons equalling 12 buttons total to play sound on. 

Sounds to be played are determined by what category of sounds you are on which will be determined by a push button to the right of the LCD screen. When pressed, it will change the category of sounds that will be played from and displayed on the LCD screen.
Current category ideas:
+ Ambient
+ Spell effects
+ Voices
+ Combat
+ Bardic Tones

LCD Screen inset in the top of the box so that when a sound is pressed, display the name of the sound file. Also to display what category of sounds you are on.
